                        I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Houston. Learning new things is one of my favorite pastimes 
                        especialy when it comes to programming. I love growing and mastering a subject, even though the challenges can defeintely be ...
                        something, it's incredibly sastisfying seeing my growth and I hope to show to whoever reading why!

                        Moving on from the rambling,I was born and raised in Houston, I'm Nigerian (shoutout my Yoruba brethen!).I watch too much anime and play a "reasonable" amount of games
                        and even do a little bit of reading. So 100% a nerd whos is suprising really into fashion! Hopefully you enjoyed reading this little Keem info sesh,

                        When it come to SWE, first and foremost, I LOVE front-end development. Being able to directly impact how the client sees my product is so fun!
                        The reason why I made this portfolio was to explore a little of the fundamentals of front-end development and I've defintely felt my 
                        passion grow even when sufferting through CSS styling.
